Last night I experienced a 'wow' moment.
I walked into a bar and saw him sitting behind the bar, alone. I walked up to him and said, "Whatcha drinking?" He replied, "I'm drinking scotch." I replied, "That's great! I'm a fan." We started talking and I found out he was fromLouisville, Kentucky. We flirted a bit and he told me that he sensed I was a virgin because I had never kissed someone before. We ordered drinks and started chatting about trivial things. Suddenly, he asked me my name. IShockingly, I knew my name! He told me his and I told him mine. We chatted for a bit more, and then he asked me out on a date. I accepted!
